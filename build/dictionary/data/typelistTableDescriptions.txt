WCRateStepAction = Types of actions that can be taken at each step of the sample Worker Comp rating process.
WCRateStepAction.Custom = No generic action is capable of processing this step so a custom action must be defined for it.
WCRateStepAction.Apply rate-based adjustment, tax, or surcharge = Calculates a new rating line by looking up a rating factor (for a state), typically to add a tax or surcharge.  If chosen, the factorName and rateConversion fields should be non-null.  Similar to the modifier action, the subtotal and granularity fields are optional.
WCRateStepAction.Apply modifier = Calculates a new rating line to give a credit or debit based on a modifier.  If chosen, the modifierID and rateConversion fields should be non-null.  If the subtotal and granularity fields are non-null, then the subtotal will be looked up and used as the basis for the calculation.  Otherwise, the subtotal up to this point will be used.
WCRateStepAction.Store subtotal = Calculates and stores a subtotal for later use in the rating algorithm.  Does not generate any new rating lines.  If chosen, the subtotal and granularity fields should be non-null.
